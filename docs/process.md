# Rise Take Home Assignment

## Time Tracking:
- first minute was spent deciding what music to put on
- With the freedom to choose whatever tech I want, I opted for a Laravel application 
    - I considered using Python, however this assignment is time bound and I wanted to use a framework I was already familiar with
    - I opted for an extremely paired down Laravel app with no front end, just a REST API
    - To manage this app, I'm using Laravel Sail, which is a Docker-based development environment
- On project setup, I established a basic `/health` endpoint to ensure the app was running
    - additionally, I created a collection in Postman to test the API
- My BigQuery configuration is also very barebones. It's helpful that I don't need to modify or do anything special with this data other than retreive it
- I spent a few minutes reading the documentation for the BigQuery API to ensure I was using it correctly
